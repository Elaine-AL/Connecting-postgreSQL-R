##load the R package required for connecting to the Postgresql database
library(RPostgreSQL)


##store the password in an object say 'passW'

passW = {"******"}
##you can put your own password above

##loading the PostgreSQL drivers and storing it in object say 'drv' 
drv = dbDriver("PostgreSQL")

##creating the connection with R to the database
con = dbConnect(drv = drv,
                dbname = "my_db",
                host = "localhost",
                port = port,
                user = "elaine",
                password = passW 
                )
##ensure you have all the permissions granted to the new user, otherwise you will get a FATAL: error

##remove the password object since you wont need it
rm(passW)

##check if a table exist in the db connected to. It gives a boolean result; if true then it exists, otherwise you might be reading from the wrong database
dbExistsTable(con, "my_table")



##read/query your data from the Postgresql db using the dbGetQuery() function in R then store it as a dataframe in R
df_my_table = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM my_table")




####You can now do your analysis in R!!!!!!
